# React-Node Expense Tracker Web App 

Welcome to the React-Node Budget Tracker Web App! This application allows users to view, add, and manage their everyday expenses. It's built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Prisma and Postgres(Thru Suppabase) for the backend. In more formal words, this stack combines modern frontend and backend technologies with a cloud-hosted database and selfmade/external API integration to create a full-stack budgeting application.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- An account on [Render](https://www.render.com/) for the deployment.
- Can use [Render] or [Suppabase] for database and migrate using prisma.  
- A [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/) for the CURRENCY API.

### Setting Up:


1. **Setting up the Backend**:

   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - **EXCHANGERATE API**:
     - Added the api key to the API_KEY variable in the .env file   

   - **Render or Supabase Setup**:
     - Create a new database instance on Render or Supabase.
     - Copy the connection string provided by Render or Supabase.

   - **Prisma Setup**:
     - Replace the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your Postgresql connection string.
     - Initialize Prisma and generate the Prisma client:
       ```bash
       npx prisma init
       npx prisma generate
       ```

   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm run server or nodemon
     ```

2. **Setting up the Frontend**:

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev or npm start
     ```
